# Pocket Spotter

#### About

Pocket Spotter is a pet project of mine I've had for a while to create a better workout log than the ones I can get on the android app store. It is built in react for the first iteration but I will also be working on writing it in Java (and possibly Swift if the reception is good on android) in the future.

This is a work in progress however if you would like to contribute, feel free to send me a message at ctprice11@gmail.com

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
